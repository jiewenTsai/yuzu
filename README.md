# 🍐 YUZU Project
It's a note-taking project using github _Issues_ and _Wiki_. 🍐 yuzu.


In a minimalist approach, [🍐 YUZU Issues](https://github.com/jiewenTsai/yuzu/issues) can serve as a personal blog, 
while the [🍐 YUZU Wiki](https://github.com/jiewenTsai/yuzu/wiki) gathers series posts to form cohensive ideas.
